    For ease of use, we are including the React, ReactDOM
    builds to make getting started as fast as possible.

    In production, you'll want to instead look at using something
    like Gulp, Grunt or WebPack (my personal recommendation)
    to compile JSX into JavaScript. Also, check out:

  The recommended approach in React is to use a container
  dive to load your react code into, rather than using `document.body`.

  This can be any element or tag name, just don't use `document.body`
  if you can avoid it.
